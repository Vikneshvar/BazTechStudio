          <h2>Impact of Political Polarization in Business Advertising and Public Relations</h2>
          <h4>Tools Used: Tensor-flow, Python Django, NLTK, Gensim, MySQL</h4>
          <h4> Dataset: News articles from MSNBC, Fox News, CNN</h4>
          <h4> Introduction </h4>
            <p> Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning powered software application that can 
              classify the political bias of a written text. It can identify words, phrases, sentences, 
              clauses, references and abbreviations that are found to be biased. This can be used by the 
              companies to improve its business communication to reach wider audience and achieve 
              high product acceptance rate. This software has achieved 90% accuracy in classifying a textual 
              content as liberally or conservatively biased.
            </p>
          <h4> Literature Review </h4>
            <p>
              A survey was conducted by SurveyMonkey and Fortune on 10,000 U.S adults to identify the
              difference of opinions toward the top 100 companies. The results observed was that the
              liberalist like shopping at Target and drinking Pepsi. On the other hand, and drinking Coke 
              Conservatives prefer shopping at Walmart. These companies have been existing for more than 50 years, 
              and they have built a healthy relationship with people through events, news stories, and advertisements. 
              Still, they were able to reach to only some political segment of the people rather the everyone.
            </p>
          <h4> Methodology </h4>
            <p>
              Neural Network: <br><br>
              A 3-layer feed forward neural network was designed in Python using the tensor-flow library. 
              The network comprises of 150,000 nodes in the input layer, 300 nodes in the hidden layer and 2 
              nodes in the output layer. We have used soft-max activation function in the output layer to obtain 
              the probability of each classification. A simple matrix multiplication of inputs, weights, and addition 
              of bias term is done at the hidden layer. We have used Adam Optimizer back propagation algorithm to 
              calculate the error contribution and optimize the accuracy. Drop out technique is also used to reduce 
              the overfitting of training data by dropping some nodes in the input and hidden layers.
              <br><br>
              Model Building:<br><br>
              The documents were split into the ratio of 2:1. The network was trained with 175 training documents 
              and validated with 25 test documents. The weights and bias were initialized to be standard normal 
              distribution numbers. The inverse document frequency values of each n-gram in a document is passed as 
              input to the network. The network learns through the feed forward and back propagation algorithms.
            </p>
          <h4> Results </h4>
            <p>
              The maximum accuracy attained during training was 100%, and during testing, it was 91.5%. 
              We achieved this with the following hyper parameters.<br>
              Learning rate: 0.001<br>
              Batch size: 25<br>
              Batch: 7<br>
              Epoch: 3<br>
              Dropout: 0.5<br>
              The weights and bias of the model are saved and used later for prediction.<br><br>
              We were able to successfully classify the input text as Liberally or Conservatively biased at 
              an accuracy of 91%. Applying this concept to the businesses will help to identify the political bias 
              that a company unintentionally creates during its communication with the users. Hence, building a 
              business communication evaluation system based on this prototype will enable the companies to reach 
              wider audience thereby increasing the profits.
